Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns. Do not include continents without cities in your output. 

select country.continent,floor(avg(city.population)) 
from country , city 
where (city.countrycode=country.code)
group by COUNTRY.continent;


Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.





select case
when A+B <= C or A+C <= B or B+C <= A then "Not A Triangle"
when A=B and B=C then "Equilateral"
when A=B or A=C or B=C then "Isosceles"
else "Scalene"
end as triangles_type
from TRIANGLES;
